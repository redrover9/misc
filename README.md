# misc
Misc quick, short, programs
for the telnetNoise program, add it to your crontab with crontab -e like so:

\* \* \* \* \* /home/$whoami/Downloads/misc-master/telnetNoise

and don't forget to chmod +x the telnetNoise file itself.
You would need to have vlc installed, or you can replace the command vlc with your music player of choice.
