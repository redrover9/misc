#TODO: convert the user input from string to int


# TODO: Create a loop that runs as long as the user has not guessed the number
	#TODO: if the user number is too high, tell the user and prompt them for input again,
	#then store that input in a variable in int format

	#TODO: Ditto if the user's guess is too low
